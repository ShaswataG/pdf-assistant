# PDF Q&A FastAPI Application

## Overview

This application provides a backend API for uploading PDF documents, extracting their text, storing them in a database, and enabling users to ask questions about the content of these PDFs using a large language model (LLM). The app supports both non-streaming and streaming responses from the LLM and maintains a chat history for each document.

---

## Architecture Overview

- **FastAPI**: Serves as the web framework handling API endpoints.
- **SQLite**: Used as the database to store documents and chat messages.
- **PDF Processing**: Utilizes PyMuPDF (`fitz`) to extract text from uploaded PDFs.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses the `TogetherLLM` model via LlamaIndex for answering questions.
- **Indexing**: Each document's text is indexed using LlamaIndexâ€™s `VectorStoreIndex` for fast retrieval of relevant context.
- **Chat History**: User questions and AI answers are stored in the database and retrievable by document.
- **CORS Middleware**: Allows cross-origin requests from specific frontend origins.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or `pip` for dependency management
- SQLite (comes bundled with Python)
- API key for TogetherAI (`TOGETHER_API_KEY`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShaswataG/pdf-assistant.git
    cd pdf-assistant
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows(powershell): .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the directory "/server" and add your TogetherAI API key:
    ```
    TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_ai_api_key_here
    ```

5. (Optional) Ensure `documents.db` SQLite database is created automatically on first run (handled by the app).

### Running the Application

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```


## The API will be available at: http://localhost:8000
